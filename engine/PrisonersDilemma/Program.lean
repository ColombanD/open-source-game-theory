-- `Prog` is the language of agents from Critch 2022 (the Python-style
-- pseudocode). It is pure *source code*: no constructor produces an
-- `Action` directly — actions only appear after evaluation via `eval`
-- in Dynamics.lean. Keeping everything at the syntactic level is what lets agents be nested,
--  substituted, and passed as subjects of formulas.

-- `Formula` is the part of the proof system `S` that agents query through the oracle,
-- just enough to express hypotheses like `"opp(CUPOD_k.source) == D"`.
-- We can see `Formula` as the language of the ambient logic in which agents reason about each other.
-- Note: `Formula` is not a full internalization of the ambient logic — it only has the constructs we need to express the theorems in this file.

-- They are mutually recursive because `.search` carries a formula as
-- its guard, and a formula's `.plays` atom takes programs as subjects:
-- agents reason about agents reasoning about agents.

-- Closing self-reference via substitution.
--
-- `.self` and `.opp` are *placeholders* (free variables) standing for
-- "my own source" and "the opponent's source" — the Python pseudocode's
-- `subst` walks replaces every `.self` with `me` and every `.opp` with `opponent`;


-- This matters because the oracle `proofSearch : Nat → Formula → Bool`
-- expects a *closed* formula — one with no free placeholders. So at every
-- evaluation boundary where a new context is entered (`.sim` and
-- `.search` in Dynamics.lean), the evaluator calls `subst` to freeze the
-- placeholders to the concrete programs currently playing the game.

-- The two definitions are mutually recursive for the same reason the
-- types are: `Prog.subst` descends into formulas at `.search`, and
-- `Formula.subst` descends into programs at `.plays`.

-- Note: `subst` is one-shot, not a fixed point. Placeholders inside the
-- freshly inserted `me`/`opponent` are *not* re-substituted — they remain
-- bound to whatever context will enclose them next.

-- Scope barrier: `.bot p` marks `p` as a *closed bot reference* — i.e. one
-- bot literally naming another bot in its source. `Prog.subst` does NOT
-- descend into `.bot p`, so the outer frame's `me`/`opponent` cannot capture
-- the placeholders inside `p`. Without this barrier, when EBot's body
-- contains `.sim .opp MirrorBot` (with `MirrorBot = .sim .opp .self`), the
-- outer `subst` rewrites `MirrorBot.subst me opp = .sim opp me` — turning a
-- probe of "what does opp do against MirrorBot?" into a self-simulation
-- shape, breaking EBot vs EBot. `.bot` is the fix point at the substitution
-- layer; `eval` (Dynamics.lean) handles `.bot` separately by simply
-- unwrapping it (one fuel decrement) so any `.self`/`.opp` inside the
-- wrapped body bind to the *current* frame, as intended.
