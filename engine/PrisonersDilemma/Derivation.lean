# The proof system `S`

The agents' internal logic, made explicit. This file defines:
* `Derivation : Formula → Type` — the inductive proof objects of `S` (its
  inference rules);
* `Provable k φ` — provability within budget `k` (a `Derivation` of size ≤ `k`,
  or an atomic σ₁ fact `AtomProvable k φ`);
* `proofSearch k φ` — the oracle the agents query, *defined* as decidable
  `Provable` (not an axiom).

`Formula.interp` (Dynamics.lean) interprets `Formula` into Lean's logic, and
`Derivation.sound` (BaseTheorems.lean) is the bridge `provability → truth`.

The only assumptions that survive are isolated to atomic `.plays` formulas
(σ₁-completeness and atom-soundness — see `AtomProvable` below). These cannot
be made constructive: any concrete definition of atom-provability that handles
`.search`-using programs must consult the truth of their guard `□_k ψ`, whose
meaning *is* `Provable` — closing the self-referential loop
`Provable → AtomProvable → (guard) Provable`. This is the Löb/Gödel
self-reference at the heart of the setup (the same reason critch22 needs PBLT),
not merely an artefact of `play` evaluation; Lean's termination checker rejects
every concrete form of it. So atom-provability stays opaque, pinned by axioms.

-- 1. The derivation system. Each rule must be (i) SOUND — its conclusion's
-- `interp` follows from its premises' (enforced by `Derivation.sound` in
-- BaseTheorems.lean) — and (ii) FAITHFUL to a real proof system `S` (≈ PA, per
-- critch22 Appendix B): it must mirror a genuine capability of `S` and must NOT
-- smuggle in semantic completeness / general reflection that PA lacks. The
-- rules fall into two layers:
--
--   • LOGICAL CORE — game-independent propositional inference S has by virtue of
--     being a logic (modus ponens, hypothetical syllogism). Sound trivially
--     because `.impl`'s `interp` is Lean implication.
--   • SOURCE-TRANSPARENCY BRIDGE — game-specific: "S can read `Prog` source
--     code", one rule per `Prog` construct it inspects (`.search`, `.sim`).
--     Justified by Appendix B(a) (S reasons about computable functions).
--
-- Deliberately ABSENT as a *constructor* (but available as axioms):
--   • An atomic-`plays` rule: it would carry a `play` hypothesis → cycle;
--     atoms go through `AtomProvable` instead.
--   • GL axiom 4 (`□φ → □□φ`): its obligation is
--     `Provable k φ → ∃K, Provable K (.box k φ)`. This is a *sound* PA principle
--     (Hilbert–Bernays–Löb D2, Solovay) — NOT dangerous reflection (the
--     dangerous one is `□φ → φ`, which we do not have). One *could* in principle
--     derive its structural half via a necessitation constructor
--     `Derivation φ → Derivation (.box k φ)`, but a SOUND such rule needs the
--     side-condition `(proof size) ≤ k`, which cannot be stated in the
--     constructor's type without size-indexing the whole `Derivation` type
--     (`Derivation : Formula → Nat → Type`) — a large change unjustified for an
--     unused principle. So axiom 4 lives wholesale as the axiom `box_provable`
--     (Axioms.lean), same status as `PBLT`/`atom_complete`.
-- Box-level principles (Löb via `PBLT`, axiom 4 via `box_provable`) are thus
-- axioms; GL's K *is* derived — as the theorem `K_provable`
-- (budget-respecting), built from `modusPonens` below; it needs no constructor.

-- 2. σ₁ atom-provability as an opaque predicate, indexed by budget `k`.
-- `AtomProvable k φ` means "S can prove the atom `φ` within `k` characters".
-- It is opaque, not defined, because any concrete definition is
-- self-referential: justifying a `.plays` atom whose subject is a `.search`
-- program requires consulting that program's guard `□_k ψ`, and `□`'s meaning
-- is `Provable` — so `AtomProvable` would depend on `Provable`, which already
-- depends on `AtomProvable` (§3). A genuine Löb-style loop Lean rejects.
--
-- The budget index is ESSENTIAL: a true atomic play is provable, but generally
-- only once the budget is large enough (its proof has a cost). At a *small*
-- budget a true atom may be unprovable. Dropping this index (the earlier
-- budget-independent version) forces every true play to be provable at every
-- budget — which collapses interactions toward cooperation and makes Critch's
-- Open Problem 3 outcome `outcome(DUPOC,CUPOD) = (D,C)` impossible to even
-- state (DUPOC could never be "unable to prove CUPOD cooperates"). The atom
-- axioms (`atom_complete`, `atom_monotone`, `AtomProvable_sound`) pin it down.
