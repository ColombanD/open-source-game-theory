/-! ## Atom certificate soundness (`PlaysProof` → real play)

The atom-side axioms `atom_monotone` and `AtomProvable_sound` are now THEOREMS:
`AtomProvable` is the constructive `PlaysProof` certificate, so monotonicity is
just relaxing its cost bound, and soundness is "a certificate yields a real
play." (Only `atom_complete`'s false-guard *completeness* stays axiomatic — see
`Axioms.lean`.) -/

HOW TO DISCHARGE A `proofSearch k φ = b` GOAL.

The two boolean directions are proved by *opposite* bridges — this asymmetry is
fundamental (Σ₁ vs Π₁), not a stylistic choice:

• `proofSearch k φ = true`  — COMPLETENESS / Σ₁ side. Exhibit a witness.
    For a plays-atom `φ = .plays p q a`: produce a real `play n p q = some a`,
    feed it to `atom_complete` (→ `AtomProvable (atom_cost n) φ`), then flip with
    `(proofSearch_spec _ _).2 (Provable.atom …)`. `proofSearch_complete_plays`
    below packages exactly this. For a structural `φ` (e.g. `.eq p p`), build the
    `Derivation` and use `Provable.struct`. You are *constructing* a proof object.

• `proofSearch k φ = false` — SOUNDNESS side, by refutation. You CANNOT exhibit
    "a proof that no proof exists" (that is Π₁); instead rule out `true` via its
    semantic consequence. Canonical pattern:
      cases h : proofSearch k φ with
      | true  => exact absurd (proofSearch_sound _ _ h) (interp_…_false …)
      | false => rfl
    i.e. if it were `true`, `proofSearch_sound` would force `φ.interp` (the bot
    would actually play that), which a computed fact (`interp_…_false`) refutes.

Mnemonic: `= true` builds a proof (atom_complete / Derivation); `= false`
destroys a hypothetical one (proofSearch_sound + contradiction). The single place
these collide is `atom_complete`'s false-guard branch — see `atom_complete_false_guard`
in Axioms.lean.
