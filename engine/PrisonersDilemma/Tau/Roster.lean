# Tau/Roster — the cast list of the six-template tau zoo

The one structural difference from the base-bot layout, and why this file must
exist BEFORE the per-bot files: a base bot references another bot by IMPORTING its
finished term, but a tau spec references other bots by NAME in a shared index (a
stage target like `.name .coop`), resolved later by the compiler — that indirection
is what makes mutual reference expressible at all. So the roster is declared first,
each `Tau/Bots/<TauBot>.lean` writes its spec against it, and `Tau/Zoo.lean` glues
the rows into the zoo. Adding a bot touches exactly: one constructor here, one new
bot file, one arm in `Zoo.lean`.

/-- The templates. (A readable enum, not `Fin n` — roadmap open question 5.)
    Extended 2026-08-18 with every base bot liftable WITHOUT `.sys`: `just`
    (JustBot — third-party prover, target Dupoc), `obot` (OBot — the behavioral
    defection-detector), `guardian` (GuardianBot — the norm enforcer, the zoo's
    first `test = .D` prover). Excluded and why: CupodBot/PrudentBot/MirrorBot/
    LegibleBot/OptimBot are self-probers (the mutual-quine wall — `.sys`);
    CIMCIC/DIMCID (implication guards), WaryBot (`.neg`), CupodTrollBot (`.eq`)
    are outside the cascade fragment; DBot needs a NEW Exclusion floor kernel for
    its δ_L cell (a frozen probe-first player sim-embedding a floor-priced
    searcher) — liftable once that kernel exists, recorded. -/
