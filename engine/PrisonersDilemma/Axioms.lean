Transport of witnesses across a parameterized formula family when the parameter grows.

This is the strongest witness-level assumption in the file. It says that if a
family of formulas `Φ : Nat → Formula` changes only by increasing its parameter
from `n` to `k`, then a witness for the smaller instance can be turned into a
witness for the larger instance, provided the original witness already fits
within the larger budget `k`.

Concretely:
* `Φ n` is the formula at the smaller parameter.
* `Φ k` is the formula at the larger parameter.
* `w` is a witness that proves the smaller formula.
* `witnessChars w ≤ k` says the witness is still within the budget available
  at the larger parameter.
* the conclusion produces a witness `w'` for the larger formula, again with
  size at most `k`.

This is the axiom that lets a proof at parameter `n` be reused when the
parameter is raised to `k`, without having to encode a specific CUPOD bridge
in the theorem file.

-- Parametric Bounded Löb's Theorem (Lemma 3.6).
--
-- Informally: let `φ k` be a formula family in the proof language of `S`,
-- `k₁ ∈ ℕ` a base threshold, and `f : ℕ → ℕ` an *increasing* computable
-- function with `f(k) ≻ O(lg k)`. If `S` can derive, for every `k > k₁`,
-- that bounded provability of `φ k` within `f(k)` steps implies `φ k`
-- itself, then there exists a threshold `k₂` beyond which `S` proves
-- `φ k` outright.
--
-- Encoding notes:
-- * `□_{f(k)}(φ k)` is the formula `Formula.box (f k) (φ k)`; its
--   semantic clause is `proofSearch (f k) (φ k) = true`.
-- * "`S` derives ψ" is `∃ m, proofSearch m ψ = true`.
-- * `f(k) ≻ O(lg k)` is spelled out as: there exists a positive constant
--   `c` and a threshold `k̂` such that for all `k > k̂`, `f(k) > c · lg k`.
-- * "Increasing" is the plain pointwise condition on `f`; the
--   "computable" side of the paper's hypothesis is vacuous in Lean since
--   every `Nat → Nat` we can write down is already computable in the
--   relevant sense.
axiom PBLT :
  ∀ (φ : Nat → Formula) (f : Nat → Nat) (k₁ : Nat),
    (∀ a b, a ≤ b → f a ≤ f b) →
    (∃ c kHat, c > 0 ∧ ∀ k, k > kHat → f k > c * Nat.log2 k) →
    (∀ k, k > k₁ → ∃ m, proofSearch m (.impl (.box (f k) (φ k)) (φ k)) = true) →
      ∃ k₂, ∀ k, k > k₂ → ∃ m, proofSearch m (φ k) = true

S can read source code: if an agent `me` is literally
`.search k ψ (.const a) (.const b)`, then S proves
`□_k ψ' → me plays a against opponent`, where `ψ' = ψ.subst me opponent`
is the closed guard formula `eval` feeds to `proofSearch`.

The implication is true by inspection of `me`'s code: a successful proof
search makes `eval` take the `.const a` branch and return `a`. We make this
an axiom because we don't model S's internals; critch22 uses the same step
silently when applying PBLT (e.g. Theorem 3.4 for CUPOD, 3.7 for DUPOC).

axiom proof_system_verifies_search_branch :
  ∀ (k : Nat) (ψ : Formula) (a b : Action) (me opponent : Prog),
    me = .search k ψ (.const a) (.const b) →
    ∃ m, proofSearch m
      (.impl (.box k (ψ.subst me opponent)) (.plays me opponent a)) = true

/--
S can read `.sim` nodes. If `me`'s literal body is `.sim p q`, then by the
`.sim` eval rule

  eval (n+1) me opp (.sim p q) = eval n p' q' p'   where p' = p.subst me opp,
                                                         q' = q.subst me opp

so `me` plays `a` against `opp` iff `p'` plays `a` against `q'`. S verifies
this by inspection of `me`'s code. Direct analogue of
`proof_system_verifies_search_branch`, but for the `.sim` constructor instead
of `.search`.
-/
axiom proof_system_verifies_sim :
  ∀ (me p q opponent : Prog) (a : Action),
    me = .sim p q →
    ∃ m, proofSearch m
      (.impl (.plays (p.subst me opponent) (q.subst me opponent) a)
             (.plays me opponent a)) = true

/--
Hypothetical syllogism in S: if S derives `φ → ψ` and `ψ → χ`, S derives
`φ → χ`. A basic structural rule for any reasonable proof system. Used to
chain `proof_system_verifies_search_branch` with `proof_system_verifies_sim`
when constructing PBLT premises for cross-pairings.

axiom proofSearch_impl_trans :
  ∀ (φ ψ χ : Formula),
    (∃ m, proofSearch m (.impl φ ψ) = true) →
    (∃ m, proofSearch m (.impl ψ χ) = true) →
    ∃ m, proofSearch m (.impl φ χ) = true
